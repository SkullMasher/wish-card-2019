## Credits, Inspiration and tools

Thanks to all the awesome people involved below ! It trully helped me fall in love even more with css. I can't believe everything that I can do with the langage.

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) - I mean it's THE web doc. When in doubt or want to find that secret magic sauce you might possibly need it's the place to go.

Easy css clip-path with [clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) by [Bennett Feely](https://bennettfeely.com/)

Colors, choosen by the awesome [Picular](https://picular.co/) website. Type keyword, get colors ! I probably found this tool on [Staphanie Walter blog/feed](https://stephaniewalter.design/).

Shooting stars code inspired from [Alex Marple pen](https://codepen.io/alexmarple/pen/moBuj).

Snowman inspiration from [Heather Shar](https://codepen.io/heatheraislinn/pen/maRzbN) and others.

Back end code handle by the php [slim framework](https://www.slimframework.com). My goto php framework for the small amount of backend code I wrote from times to times.

[Layout Land](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag/videos) is a goldmine of modern css knowledge. It's for me the key thing that got me into true modern, best practice CSS. [Jen Simmons] work is pushing grumpy nerd like me in front end future.
